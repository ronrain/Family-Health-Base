## Usage
The key to a successful and high quality life is to keep yourself healthy. Whether it be eating right or exercising, individuals need to prioritize their health. Family Health Base allows users to prioritize their health by keeping track of their doctor appointments, for themselves and for their families. Whether it be for the dentist, a physical or a serious issue, users can input their appointment details so they can keep track of their diagnosis and treatments. Users can keep track of all their family members appointments and keep up to date information about themselves and their family members. Users can input their information like height and weight, and update that after a physical or when they wake up. Knowing when you have an appointment and what was discussed during the appointment will help family members always remember how to take care of themselves.
